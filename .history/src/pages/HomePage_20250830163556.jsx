                <section>
                  <p>
                    An NDIS plan is a personalized support plan created for
                    participants of the National Disability Insurance Scheme
                    (NDIS) in Australia. The plan outlines the individual’s goals,
                    needs, and the types of support and services they are eligible
                    to receive under the NDIS. Here are the key components of an
                    NDIS plan:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Personal Goals: The plan includes the participant's goals
                      and aspirations, such as improving daily living skills,
                      gaining employment, or increasing community participation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Support Categories: It details the types of support and
                      services required to achieve these goals. This can include
                      personal care, therapy services, assistive technology, or
                      home modifications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Funding Allocation: The plan specifies how much funding is
                      allocated for different categories of support and how this
                      funding can be used. This can be in the form of core
                      supports, capital supports, or capacity building supports.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Service Providers: It may list approved service providers or
                      allow participants to choose their own providers to deliver
                      the necessary supports.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Plan Review: The plan is reviewed periodically (usually
                      annually) to assess progress and make adjustments based on
                      changes in needs, goals, or circumstances. This is where you
                      gather all of your provider’s progress reports or updated
                      functional assessment reports
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Overall, an NDIS plan is designed to ensure that individuals
                    with disabilities receive the necessary support to live as
                    independently and inclusively as possible.

                    responsibilities, such as paying providers and keeping track
                    of spending, while the participant still has flexibility in

                    is an Australian government initiative designed to support
                    people with significant and permanent disabilities. It
                    provides funding for services and supports that are tailored
                    to an individual's needs, enabling them to live as
                    independently as possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The NDIS focuses on long-term assistance, including therapies,
                    equipment, and personal care, to help participants achieve
                    their goals in areas like education, employment, and social
                    participation.

                  <p>
                    In contrast, <span class="note">Medicare</span> is Australia's
                    universal health care system that covers basic medical
                    services for all Australians, including doctor visits,
                    hospital care, and essential treatments. Medicare is not
                    specifically designed for disability-related needs but rather
                    offers general health care. While both NDIS and Medicare are
                    government-funded, NDIS is more specialised in supporting
                    people with disabilities, whereas Medicare provides broad
                    health coverage for the general population.

                    Yes, you can pay privately for occupational therapy (OT)
                    services. Private OT services are available to individuals who
                    may not qualify for government-funded programs like the NDIS
                    or Medicare or who prefer to access additional or specific
                    services beyond what is covered.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Paying privately allows for greater flexibility in choosing
                    the therapist, the type of therapy, and the frequency of
                    sessions, making it an option for those seeking more
                    personalised or immediate care.
